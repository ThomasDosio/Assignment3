# Exercise 6: Document and reflect on your design!

There is no code to write in this exercise.

If you have completed all five if the exercises so far (or even if you haven't), now is always a good time to reflect 
on your design, and to document your code / design.  As suggested in the readme, you might also have been doing this 
incrementally as you work on the coding exercises, in which case this exercise should be fairly easy.

Start by writing down the key data structures, classes, and methods, and identifying any points where you weren't initially
sure what to do, or where you identified more than one possible way to solve a problem and why you chose the approach 
you did.  Where appropriate, consider adding comments or documentation comments to your code.

Think also about other possible tasks you might be asked to accomplish by using or extending this code.  What happens
if the client changes this or that requirement?  How easy will it be to adapt what you did?  

This might also be a good time to try out some refactorings to clean up your code, in anticipation of potentially needing
to add or change features in the assessed part of assignment 3.  

If you have been working with others, please make sure each of you has a clean copy of whatever solution you have come 
up with along with its design document, as you are not to communicate with others in any way while working on the 
assessed  part.  If one person has done the majority of coding, now might be a good time for the other person to take 
over and make sure they ask questions about why the code is the way it is.  This may be helpful for both people.  

Finally, please document what assistance you obtained in an `acknowledgments.md` file.  This should be submitted with 
your assessed version of Assignment 3.

**You should satisfy yourself that you understand the solution to the warmup exercise well enough to build on it, because 
you will be asked to do exactly that in the assessed part of assignment 3, without consulting others.**
